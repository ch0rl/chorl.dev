    <h2>What is the <abbr title="Relationships, Health, and Sex Education">RHSE</abbr> Guidance?</h2>
    <p>
        Available <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-education-relationships-and-sex-education-rse-and-health-education" target="_blank">here</a>, the new statutory guidance covers relationships, health, and sex education and will come into force on 1 September 2026.
        As statutory guidance, schools must have due regard for its contents and only vary from it with good reason.
    </p>

    <h2>Issues with the Guidance Itself</h2>
    <p>
        Overall, the issues with the guidance seem to stem from the transphobic idea that sex and gender are &ldquo;contested&rdquo; topics.
        Despite being untrue, credence is given to the sex-essentialist argument that gender does not exist.
        Notably, the same approach is not taken in relation to vaccination &ldquo;skepticism&rdquo; or &ldquo;flat earth&rdquo; conspiracies.

                <td>
                    The use of &ldquo;gender questioning&rdquo; is a clear attempt to de-legitimise trans identity in children - implying that such children are not trans, but &ldquo;just exploring&rdquo; (see also the &ldquo;it's just phase&rdquo; rhetoric).

                    This, of course, bends to the so-called &ldquo;gender-critical&rdquo; <abbr title="Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists">TERFs</abbr>, ignoring the reality that the &ldquo;facts&rdquo; of sex and gender are well established:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sex is a generally binary (though, not always) system based on a person&rsquo;s biology; one is assigned to a sex at birth.</li>
                        <li>
                            Gender is a social construct to which most people (especially in the West) subscribe.
                            Persons identify with a category, most often inline with their sex, which generally describes the way they go about life.
                            Though, as the feminist and anti-patriarchy movements advance, the overlap between genders becomes ever more blurred.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Furthermore, the &ldquo;facts&rdquo; are not actually defined in the guidance, leaving room for gender-critical ideologies to make their way into the classroom (i.e., being trans is a mental illness).

                    This is simply false, as every person identifies with a gender identity (I guess you could argue that agender people do not, but I highly doubt this is what the DfE meant).

                    Again, this is just wrong: for trans people, social transition can be a great - reversible - way to manage feelings of dysphoria.
                    Furthermore, managing feelings of dysphoria through social transition can prevent suicide, so to say the opposite is to avoid preventing suicides.

                        Where schools decide to use external resources, they should avoid materials that use cartoons or diagrams that oversimplify this topic, that could be interpreted as being aimed at younger children, or that perpetuate stereotypes or encourage pupils to question their gender.

                </td>
                <td>
                    The beginning of this paragraph is clearly aimed at the <a href="https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/genderbread-person/" target="_blank">&ldquo;Genderbread Person&rdquo;</a>, which was subject to right-wing backlash (<a href="https://www.gbnews.com/news/stonewall-how-they-influenced-the-bbc-with-use-of-a-genderbread-person/143293" target="_blank">GB News</a>, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10276779/Civil-servants-shown-disputed-genderbread-person-graphic-presentation.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a>).
                    Regardless of backlash, this diagram can be helpful to explain the intertwined identities of sex, gender, presentation, identity, and attraction.
                    Furthermore, barring anything that would &ldquo;encourage pupils to question their gender&rdquo; is incredibly concerning and reminiscent of Thatcher&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28" target="_blank">&ldquo;Section 28&rdquo;</a>.

        The Secretary of Stateâ€™s view is that no categories of persons with a protected characteristic will be negatively impacted by the policy.

    <h2>The Families Impact Assessment</h2>
    <p>
        Disclosed to me <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/rhse_guidance_impact_assessments" target="_blank">here</a>, the DfE also performed a &ldquo;Families Impact Assessment&rdquo;, which I have typeset <a href="{% url 'rhse-annex' %}">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary issue with this impact assessment is that it makes no mention of families with trans members.
        For example, same-sex couples are explicitly mentioned.
    </p>

    <h2>&ldquo;Gender Questioning Children&rdquo; Guidance</h2>
    <p>
        Also pertinent is the &ldquo;Gender Questioning Children&rdquo; guidance (<a href="https://consult.education.gov.uk/equalities-political-impartiality-anti-bullying-team/gender-questioning-children-proposed-guidance/supporting_documents/Gender%20Questioning%20Children%20%20nonstatutory%20guidance.pdf" target="_blank">draft</a>) that opened for consultation on 19 December 2023 and closed on 12 March 2024.
        As far as I can tell, the Government is still working on the guidance (see <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/gender_questioning_childrens_gui" target="_blank">FOI response 2025-0021608</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        This guidance would be non-statutory, but still recommended to be followed.
        For now, I will refrain from comment, as I expect it to change soon enough in light of <abbr title="Equality and Human Rights Commission">EHRC</abbr> guidance.
