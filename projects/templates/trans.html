                            As very succinctly put by the UN Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (IESOGI), in a letter to the government of the UK:<sup>[<a href="#ref:iesogi:uk" class="cite"></a>: p. 3]</sup>
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            gender identity must be recognised by law, and implemented under a standard of self-identification.
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>
                            The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights goes into more detail, recommending that:<sup>[<a href="#ref:unhr:free-and-eq" class="cite"></a>: p. 121]</sup>
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            states should provide a straightforward administrative process to officially recognize the self-identified gender identity and name of transgender persons through a simple declaration without such requirements as medical certification or diagnosis, surgery or medical treatment, divorce or sterilization.
                            This process should include the ability to obtain new official documents reflecting self-identified gender, first name, gender marker and appearance. [...]
                            Legislation should allow for recognition of non-binary gender identities.
                            Minors should have access to recognition of their gender identity.
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>This is supported in another of the {{ IESOGI }}'s reports:<sup>[<a href="#ref:iesogi:protection" class="cite"></a>: &para;21 and &para;23]</sup></p>
                        <blockquote>
                            Self-determined gender is a fundamental part of a person&rsquo;s free and autonomous choice in relation to roles, feelings, forms of expression and behaviours, and a corner stone of the person&rsquo;s identity.
                            The resulting obligation of States is to provide access to gender recognition in a manner consistent with the rights to freedom from discrimination, equal protection of the law, privacy, identity and freedom of expression. [...]
                            lack of legal recognition negates the identity of the concerned persons to such an extent that it provokes what can be described as a fundamental rupture of State obligations.
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Furthermore, the Yogyakarta Principles establish that states shall:<sup>[<a href="#ref:yprinciples" class="cite"></a>: Principle 3(B-C)]</sup></p>
                        <blockquote>
                            take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to fully respect and legally recognise each person’s self-defined gender identity;
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                            take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to ensure that procedures exist whereby all state-issued identity papers which indicate a person’s gender/sex — including birth certificates, passports, electoral records and other documents — reflect the person’s profound self-defined gender identity;
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>This is expanded upon in the Yogyakarta Principles plus 10, which call on states to:<sup>[<a href="#ref:yprinciples+10" class="cite"></a>: Principle 31(C)]</sup></p>

                        </blockquote>

                        <p>The {{ IESOGI }} combats so-called &ldquo;gender-critical&rdquo; arguments (more below):<sup>[<a href="#ref:iesogi:uk" class="cite"></a>: p. 13]</sup></p>
                        <blockquote>
                            the human rights of trans women are not dependent on the hypothetical risk that predatory men could disguise themselves as such and perpetrate crime [...]
                        </blockquote>
                        <blockquote>
                            in the countries that have legal recognition of gender identity based on self-identification, there is no credible evidence to suggest systemic risk of predatory men using the process of identifying and living as a woman as an opportunity to perpetrate gender or sexual-based violence.
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>These opinions are not restricted to the UN either (not that it would matter if so); the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe called on states to:<sup>[<a href="#ref:eu:res2048" class="cite"></a>: &para;6.2]</sup></p>

                            there is no justification to defend a system of oppression to the detriment of the individual; on the contrary, there is a moral imperative to defend the individual&rsquo;s freedom from violence and discrimination.
                            States have before them an urgent duty to establish legal gender recognition based on self-determination - while they fail to do so, they continue to enable much human rights abuse around the world.

                        <p>The EU supports this, saying:<sup>[<a href="#ref:eu:combatting:C" class="cite"></a>: &para;13-14]</sup></p>

                            This exposes transgender detainees who have not obtained legal recognition of their identity to a range of violations and safety and security risks, highlighting the need for treatment of transgender detainees to be based on self-identification instead, even when legal recognition has not (yet) been obtained.

                        <h4>Wait Times & GICs</h4>
                        <p>
                            Currently, the only way to access medical transition in the UK is through a Gender Identity Clinic (GIC).
                            To be seen at a GIC, one must first get referred; while some clinics allow self-referrals, not all do.<sup>[<a href="#ref:ta:gics" class="cite"></a>]</sup>
                            There have been many reports of GPs refusing to refer people, to the point where asking &ldquo;which GPs at [surgery] are trans-inclusive&rdquo; is a normal question raised within queer groups.
                            Once a referral has been made, the wait begins.
                            Wait times vary wildly between clinics, ranging from months to years,<sup>[<a href="#ref:ta:gics" class="cite"></a>]</sup> with most people experiencing over three year waits.
                            Clinics will generally refuse to give updates during this time, even to GPs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once seen, the first appointment will typically only be a screening assessment; it would only be after the second appointment where any medical intervention would be considered.<sup>[<a href="#ref:ta:1st-appt" class="cite"></a>]</sup>
                            The time between the first and second appointments ranges from six to twelve months, typically.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People have also noted that to get the care they need, they have to express their gender as being very binary.
                            Non-binary and gender-nonconforming people who do not fit neatly into the binary gender stereotypes have faced barriers in the GIC process.
                            The advice circulated through queer spaces is to act in line with the binary if one wishes to access healthcare; examples of this would be:
                        </p>
                        <ul>

                            UK law recognises gender through a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;legal sex&rdquo;, which is either male or female, and can be &ldquo;modified&rdquo; for most purposes by a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC).
                        </p>

                        <h4>GRC Process</h4>

                        </ul>

                        <p>You must also provide:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A <abbr title="A declaration signed by a qualified professional.">statutory declaration</abbr>, stating that the above are true, the sex you have transitioned to, the date on which you transitioned, whether you are married or in a civil partnership, and details thereof,</li>

                            <li>&ldquo;Sex&rdquo;, in the Equality Act 2010, refers to one&rsquo;s sex assigned at birth, and is not modified by a GRC, and</li>

                        <p>This change in legislative interpretation removed trans people&rsquo;s right to access single-sex spaces and enforced a discriminatory, reductive, definition of sex in law.</p>

                        <h3>Compared to International Opinion</h3>

                        <h4>Self-ID</h4>
                        <p>The UK does not operate on a system of self-identification; on 19 March 2025, the Government said:<sup>[<a href="#ref:petition:self-id" class="cite"></a>]</sup></p>
                        <blockquote>
                            The Gender Recognition Act 2004 is a robust piece of legislation that reflects the seriousness of changing a person&rsquo;s legal gender.
                            The Government will not be introducing self-identification.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>This is at odds to the international opinion that:<sup>[<a href="#ref:iesogi:uk" class="cite"></a>: p. 3]</sup></p>
                        <blockquote>
                            gender identity must be recognised by law, and implemented under a standard of self-identification
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>This was most recently recommended to the UK by the {{ IESOGI }} on 11 April 2024:<sup>[<a href="#ref:iesogi:uk2" class="cite"></a>: p. 17]</sup></p>
                        <blockquote>
                            [The UK should] simplify the administrative process of legal recognition of gender identity, in accordance with internationally recognized good practices of legal recognition of gender identity based on self-determination by the applicant, without abusive requirements, including for non-binary persons and children;
                        </blockquote>

                        <h4>Medical Requirements</h4>
                        <p>
                            A system of self-identification would necessarily do without any medical requirement, but it is still interesting to interrogate on its own.
                            On 19 March 2025, the Government said (my emphasis):<sup>[<a href="#ref:petition:self-id" class="cite"></a>]</sup>
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            The Government is committed to modernising, simplifying and reforming the legal gender recognition process to remove indignities for trans people <strong>whilst retaining the need for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria</strong>.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>However, it was previously recommended by the House of Commons' Women and Equalities Committee that:<sup>[<a href="#ref:wec:reform-gra" class="cite"></a>: &para;97]</sup></p>
                        <blockquote>
                            The Government should remove the diagnosis of gender dysphoria from the Gender Recognition Act by 2023, reflecting the support for this in responses to its own consultation.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>This is supported by a vast array of international resources listed prior.</p>

                        <p>Most recently, a trans man was refused a GRC because he was trying to conceive;<sup>[<a href="#ref:glp:mpreg" class="cite"></a>]</sup> this seems blatantly contrary to the prior-analysed statements that gender recognition must not require sterilisation.<sup>[e.g., <a href="#ref:unhr:free-and-eq" class="cite"></a>: p. 121]</sup></p>

                        <h4>Non-Binary Genders</h4>
                        <p>
                            The UK only recognises &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;female&rdquo;; UK courts have upheld this as being inline with international obligations.<sup>[<a href="#ref:c-v-grp" class="cite"></a>, <a href="#ref:ec-v-hs" class="cite"></a>]</sup>
                            This, of course, goes against the recommendation of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights that &ldquo;legislation should allow for recognition of non-binary gender identities&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="#ref:unhr:free-and-eq" class="cite"></a>: p. 121]</sup>, Council of Europe recommendation that &ldquo;[states should] consider including a third gender option in identity documents for those who seek it&rdquo;,<sup>[<a href="#ref:eu:res2048" class="cite"></a>: 6.2.4]</sup> and others.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Children</h4>
                        <p>
                            As one must be 18 or older to apply for a GRC, this process is not open to children.
                            This is contrary to international opinion and recommendations.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Timescales</h4>
                        <p>
                            Nominally, the GRC process should take 2 years (&ldquo;have been living in your gender for at least 2 years&rdquo;) + 22 weeks (&ldquo;the panel will usually look at your application within 22 weeks of applying&rdquo;).
                            However, this overlooks the drastic issues with accessing healthcare right now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a GRC application requires a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, one must consider the time that that takes to get.
                            Such a diagnosis is only made from practitioners within a Gender Identity Clinic (GIC).
                            To get a diagnosis, one will need to:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Get referred, as some clinics do not allow for self-referrals (note: success in being referred is dependent on how accepting one&rsquo;s GP is),</li>
                            <li>Wait for 1-8 years for the first appointment (typically on the higher end of that range),<sup>[<a href="#ref:ta:gics" class="cite"></a>]</sup></li>
                            <li>Wait around 1 year for a second appointment, where a diagnosis may be made.</li>

                        <h3>UK Policy</h3>

                        <p>
                            Current UK policy houses trans men in line with their &ldquo;legal&rdquo; gender (as modified by a Gender Recognition Certificate<sup>[<a href="#ref:psi:trans" class="cite"></a>: p. 9]</sup>).
                            Trans women, however, can only be housed in the women&rsquo;s estate if they have no history of sexual or violent offending, no birth genitalia, and a Gender Recognition Certificate.<sup>[<a href="#ref:psi:trans-diagram" class="cite"></a>]</sup>
                        </p>

                        <img src="{% static 'images/2024_11_14_Annex_A_-_Transgender_Prisoners_-_Initial_Allocation_Process_Map.pdf.png' %}" alt="A flowchart explaining the placement of transgender prisoners in the UK" width="60%" class="p-3" />

                        <h3>Compared to International Opinion</h3>
                        <p>It is no suprise that &ldquo;there [have] been incidents of suicides by trans women held in men&rsquo;s prisons&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="#ref:iesogi:uk2" class="cite"></a>: &para;66]</sup></p>

                        <p>
                            Taking into account the above, and the UK&rsquo;s approach to legal gender recognition, it is clear that the UK is not following international opinion on the treatment of detainees.
                            While this primarily stems from the lack of self-ID, the treatment based on genitalia deserves its own critique.
                            Prohibiting trans women from being in the women&rsquo;s estate solely due to their genitalia is not only dehumanising but also feeds into the rhetoric that trans women are all sexual predators; this is reinforced in the fact that one&rsquo;s &ldquo;anatomy&rdquo; forms part of their risk assessment.<sup>[<a href="#ref:psi:trans" class="cite"></a>: &para;4.24]</sup>
                            The {{ IESOGI }} describes these as &ldquo;deeply discriminatory stereotypes of trans and gender diverse persons based on ideas of predatory determinism&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="#ref:iesogi:law-practices" class="cite"></a>: p. 6]</sup>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The searching policy brings other issues, as prisoners are generally treated in accordance with the estate they are in (men&rsquo;s or women&rsquo;s).
                            For one, transgender people without a GRC will be searched by officers of the same sex;<sup>[<a href="#ref:psi:search:a" class="cite"></a>: p. 3]</sup> clearly, this would cause immense distress, especially in the context of &ldquo;full&rdquo; searches<sup>[see <a href="#ref:psi:search" class="cite"></a>: &sect;4.11]</sup> (strip searches, colloquially).
                            As these searches are the minimum requirement for incoming prisoners in the male estate,<sup>[<a href="#ref:psi:search" class="cite"></a>: &para;4.7.7]</sup> it is foreseeable that the vast majority of transfeminine prisoners will be forced to strip in front of two male prison officers.
                            Of course, transmasculine prisoners would also suffer embarrassment and malgendering, but may not be subject to a &ldquo;full&rdquo; search, as the minimum requirement for the women&rsquo;s estate is a rub-down and hand-held metal detector search.<sup>[<a href="#ref:psi:search" class="cite"></a>: &sect;4.6]</sup>
                            A full search could be conducted if there was suspicion that the prisoner was concealing something,<sup>[<a href="#ref:psi:search" class="cite"></a>: &para;4.6.2]</sup> which could arise if, say, the prisoner is wearing a packer (a device used to give the impression of a bulge in the crotch).
